NAME
	lib0 - the zero library

DESCRIPTION
	lib0 is a conforming C89 utility library providing boilerplate
	functionality and aims to produce small object files suitable
	for static linking.

RATIONALE
	Libraries such as Glib are big, bloated, and provide nonintuitive
	APIs with mile long, underscore ridden, function names.
	They also are no good for static linking.
